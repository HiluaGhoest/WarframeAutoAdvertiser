# WarframeAutoAdvertiser
Send advertisements in the Trading chat while AFK


## Features
- Send advertisements in the Trading chat while AFK;
- Send advertisements while you use another application. eg: youtube video;
- The script search for the chatbox location, so you do not have to worry aboout not finding the Trading chat.


## Notes (Im working on it, wait for later updates)
- you should have 5 chat tabs opened (Squad / Clan / Alliance or Region / Recruiting / Trading chat)   or   (Squad / Dojo / Clan / Alliance or Recruiting / Trading chat)
if you are not in a clan, you can activate any another chats (eg: region), **but it will only work if youre in orbiter, not in dojo**
